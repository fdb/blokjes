====
* Allow the user to change the colors.
* Save the colors in the document.
* Add persistence through Backbone.js.
* Make the grid scale configurable per layer.
* Check that blocks are never out of bounds ( 0 <= x <= CANVAS_WIDTH )
* Add per-layer offset. Use arrow-keys to offset current layer.
* More compact over-the-wire format?
